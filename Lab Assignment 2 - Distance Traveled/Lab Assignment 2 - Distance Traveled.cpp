//
// Author: Derrick Li
// Date Created 3 March 2021
// Purpose: Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula: Distance = Speed x Time
// A car is traveling at a constant 60 miles per hour.
// Design a program that displays the following:
// The distance the car will travel in 5 hours
// The distance the car will travel in 8 hours
// The distance the car will travel in 12 hours

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
}
